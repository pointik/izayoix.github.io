Hi, I'm Aditi, the artist behind all the peices shown here. I'm still a high school student, but I hope to work as an illastrator or something of the sort in the future. 

I enjoy creating artwork through different mediums, my favourite being watercolours. I occasionally dabble 2 dimensional digital art, but recently I've also been interested in 3D modelling and game design. 

My other interests include reading, writing, listening to music and palying video games
